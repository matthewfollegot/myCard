#myCard

This repository contains the code which was used to create a web-applciation that revolutionalizes business cards.
The vision behind the idea was that business cards are old in a digital world and this was the problem that was addressed.
Contacts will go into the user's phone and updated contact info will be synced to all of the individual's contacts in real time.

Angular was used in the front-end, Flask in the back-end with a PyMongo wrapper to link the MongoDB database.
